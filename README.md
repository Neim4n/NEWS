    ### API

    These APIs help me make my site more flexible and easier to use. With the help of these APIs, I was able to get up-to-date information about currencies and the situation in the world.

    - [GNews](https://gnews.io/)



    ### Internationalization

    [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) was used to internationalize a News Site.

    I18next is an internationalization-framework written in and for JavaScript.
    ### Adaptive & Responsive design

    To make a responsive and adaptive design for my project, was used technologies such as:

    - Flexbox
    - Grid Layout

    For comfortable writing component styles, was used a preprocessor SCSS.
